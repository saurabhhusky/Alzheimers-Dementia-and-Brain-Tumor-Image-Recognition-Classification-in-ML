Project Overview:
This project focuses on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyse medical imaging data to detect and classify Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and brain tumours. By leveraging advanced algorithms and neuroimaging data, the study aims to develop robust predictive models that can accurately identify these neurodegenerative disorders.

Key Responsibilities:
• Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Collected and pre-processed MRI scans from diverse datasets to standardize input data, including normalization, resizing, and data augmentation (rotations, flips, translations, and zooms) to enhance model training and mitigate class imbalance. • Model Development: Developed and fine-tuned various machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Utilized transfer learning with pre-trained architectures such as ResNet, CNN to improve model accuracy and efficiency. • Evaluation and Optimization: Conducted thorough model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC. Implemented hyperparameter tuning and regularization techniques to enhance model performance and generalizability. • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA to understand dataset characteristics, identify patterns, and compare the performance of different models in disease detection and classification tasks.

Key Achievements:
• High-Accuracy Predictive Models: Successfully developed models with high accuracy in detecting and classifying Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and brain tumours, contributing to early diagnosis and better treatment planning. • Advanced Analytical Techniques: Applied state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms to medical imaging data, demonstrating proficiency in handling complex datasets and extracting meaningful insights. • Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Worked closely with medical experts to validate imaging data, ensuring the reliability and clinical relevance of the predictive models.

Created a dashboard in Power BI
Data Load and Cleaning: We start by importing the MIRIAD dataset into Power BI using the "Get Data" option. Together, we review and clean the data, addressing any missing or inconsistent values.
Demographic Analysis: Collaboratively, we explore demographic data, creating visuals like bar charts to compare age, gender, and baseline MMSE scores for Alzheimer's and control groups. Utilize scatter plots or box plots to examine the relationship between age and baseline MMSE scores.
Temporal and Scanning Timepoints Analysis: Visualize changes in MMSE scores over time using line charts. Analyze the distribution of scanning time points and completed scans at each interval.
Key Findings:
Summarize initial insights into demographic differences and temporal patterns. Identify any notable trends or variations in the dataset.

Technical Skills:
• Programming Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras) • Machine Learning Algorithms: CNNs, SVMs, KNN, ANNs, ResNet, DenseNet • Data Processing: MRI image preprocessing, feature extraction, data augmentation • Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC • Tools: Jupyter Notebooks, Git, SQL, PowerBI

Impact:
The project significantly advances the field of medical imaging by integrating machine learning techniques to improve the detection and classification of neurodegenerative disorders. Early diagnosis facilitated by these models can lead to timely interventions and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and quality of life.
